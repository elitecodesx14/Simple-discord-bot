# Simple-discord-bot
A simple discord bot that I made following a tutorial, in hinesight was a little too advanced for my skill level but discords API definitely helped with that
Obviously use your own token for the discord bot as its your own personal token, and with this token people can do bad things so keep that to yourself :3.
I will be removing my token from the code and replacing it with text saying "PUT YOUR TOKEN HERE" which should make it obvious where you need to put it.
If you have any questions let me know.
